# xstrings #

Go [strings](http://golang.org/pkg/strings) package only has a few string algorithms. There are lots of other useful algorithms missing.

`xstrings` is to fill the gap. It will include as many useful string algorithm as possible. Please [create new issue](https://github.com/huandu/xstrings/issues) if you find one string algorithm is useful but not in either `strings` and `xstrings`.
